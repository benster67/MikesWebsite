<p>NEW YORK CITY - September 5, 2003 - New York City Health and Mental Hygiene 
Commissioner Thomas R. Frieden, MD, MPH, joined by Dr. Henry Falk, Associate 
Administrator for the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and 
Director of CDC's National Center for Environmental Health, as well as Timothy 
S. Carey, CEO and President of the Hugh L. Carey Battery Park City Authority, 
today announced the launching of the World Trade Center Health Registry, a 
comprehensive health survey that will follow the health of those most directly 
exposed to the World Trade Center collapse and subsequent clean-up efforts. The 
project was announced today at a press conference held at Robert F. Wagner Jr. 
Park in Lower Manhattan.</p>
<p>&quot;The effects of 9/11 are still being felt today by all New Yorkers, and all 
Americans,&quot; said Dr. Frieden. &quot;Hundreds of thousands of people from all walks of 
life were in the vicinity of the twin towers when they collapsed, and were 
exposed to a combination of smoke, dust, and debris. We need to study the health 
of these people in order to understand the possible health consequences related 
to 9/11. If you were there on 9/11, you are strongly encouraged to sign up for 
the WTC Health Registry.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr. Falk said, &quot;The World Trade Center Health Registry will do what no other 
health survey is doing; it will record and measure the health impact of 9/11 in 
the broadest possible terms. The Registry is a tool for giving us health data 
that could guide how we respond to this kind of disaster for generations to 
come. The more people enroll - even if they feel perfectly healthy - the better 
our chances will be of understanding any health effects from this tragic event.&quot;</p>
<p>Madelyn Wils, Chairwoman for Community Board One in Manhattan said, &quot;I urge 
everyone who lived or worked near the WTC site on 9/11 to enroll in this 
important health survey so that we can accurately document the long-term health 
impacts of 9/11. Community Board 1 will work closely with the Department of 
Health and Mental Hygiene so that community input is included in the health 
registry, and to ensure that health findings are disseminated throughout the 
downtown community.&quot;</p>
<p>President Carey said, &quot;I plan to enroll in the World Trade Center Health 
Registry, and I encourage all Battery Park City residents and workers who were 
here on 9/11 to step forward and enroll too.&quot;</p>
<p>The World Trade Center (WTC) Health Registry is designed to enroll people 
most directly exposed to WTC site on or around September 11, 2001. The goal is 
to follow up with people periodically over the next 20 years to track any 
changes in their physical or mental health. It is the largest health registry 
ever attempted.</p>
<p>Those who enroll in the WTC Health Registry will be asked to complete a 30 
minute telephone survey of where they were on 9/11, how long they were in areas 
with smoke and fumes, and whether they have had any health problems since. 
Registrants will be periodically contacted to answer questions about any health 
changes. This information will then be compared with that of the general 
population to identify any health problems possibly linked to 9/11. Ultimately, 
findings drawn from the health registry will enable researchers to observe 
patterns that may be invisible to individual physicians. All information given 
will be kept strictly private and confidential. No medical examinations or tests 
are required.</p>
<p>The public will be regularly informed about information from the WTC Health 
Registry through quarterly reports that will be posted online at
<a href="http://www.wtcregistry.org">www.wtcregistry.org</a>. The first report 
is expected to be available in the fall of 2003.</p>
<p><strong>Eligible Populations</strong></p>
<p>People from the five boroughs, the greater metropolitan area, and throughout 
the country will be eligible for the WTC Health Registry, regardless of whether 
they have any health problems. Those in anyone one or more of the following 
categories are eligible to enroll:</p>
<ul>
  <li>People who were in a building, on the street, or on the subway south of 
  Chambers Street on 9/11/01; </li>
  <li>Workers involved in the rescue, recovery, or clean-up at the WTC site 
  and/or WTC Recovery Operations on Staten Island any time between 9/11/01 and 
  6/30/02; </li>
  <li>Students and staff at schools (pre-K to 12) or daycare centers south of 
  Canal Street on 9/11/01; or </li>
  <li>People who were living south of Canal Street on 9/11/01. </li>
</ul>
<p>The health registry will compile a list of exposed persons and collect 
baseline information by interviewing and periodically re-interviewing exposed 
persons. It is intended to complement, rather than replace, other more detailed 
health studies already underway, and may serve as baseline for targeted 
populations as well as a future source for study samples.</p>
<p>The WTC Health registry is a jointly funded effort of the New York City 
Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), the Agency for Toxic Substances 
and Disease Registry (ATSDR) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). RTI 
International, a non-profit research firm, will be conducting interviews.</p>
